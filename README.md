# NTU Chatbot_Training

#This repo contains the manuals that I wrote for NTU when I was developing the chatbot for the University when I was in Year 1. 
There are 3 manuals:
1. Step-by-Step Guide (for complete beginners to kickstart using and get interested in the bot building process) 
2. The Dialogflow Manual (The Comprehensive Guide to buidling conversations that are human like and best practices to do so)
3. The Technical Manual (The advanced manual for building aggregate based system to support scalability) 

The repo is closed, and no further amendments are likely to be made as I have stepped down from my position as advisor to the new chatbot
building team in NTU.
